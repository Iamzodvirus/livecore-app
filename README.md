## **Overview**

Livescore app, a react based project, is a sport app which is built to help sport fan to know all the updates about live games. Livescore provides information like the current score, the number of goals andalso the winner of games by sending them push notifications.

### **Inspiration**

Livescore app was created as a result of our curiosity of our sport fans, asides getting update about livescores and fixtures, they also get information and news update about their teams and players.
